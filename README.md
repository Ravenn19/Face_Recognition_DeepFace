# 👤 Face Recognition & Analysis with DeepFace

This project demonstrates how to build a face recognition and face analysis system using the [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) library and Python. It can detect, analyze, and compare human faces from images with just a few lines of code.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Face detection from image
- ✅ Face attribute analysis: **Age**, **Gender**, **Emotion**, and **Race**
- ✅ Face verification (are two faces the same person?)
- ✅ Image display using OpenCV and Matplotlib
- ✅ Easy to extend and integrate with apps or APIs
